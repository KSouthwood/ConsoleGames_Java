# Console Games

A collection of games played in the console/terminal written in Java.
This is a grouping of games written with the intention of using packages
and breaking each game out into its own separate package.

### Tic-Tac-Toe

The classic one. Can be played with one or two players with one player taking
on the computer, with three different difficulty levels. (Good luck with the
hard setting!)
